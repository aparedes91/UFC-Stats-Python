# Ultimate Fighting Championship Historical Data (1993-2021)
This project provided by CareerFoundry deals with a database from a mixed martial arts organization headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.
# Objective
Each row contains a compilation of red and blue fighterâ€™s statistics which includes significant strikes, height, weight, number of rounds, fight type, and winner of the bout from 1993 to 2021. The purpose of this analysis is to answer the following:

Hypothesis: The more strikes a fighter attempts, the more strikes are landed to his or her opponent.

Questions:
1. Which fighting corner has won the most bouts?
2. What is the most common method in winning a fight? Which weight division has the most wins via KO/TKO?
3. Does the stance give a fighter an advantage?
4. Does age play a factor in winning a fight?
5. Where do fighters often win?
